    Start a simple number guessing game where the user guesses a number between 0 and 5.

    Gameplay:
        - A random number between 0 and 5 is generated each round.
        - The user inputs their guess.
            - Correct guess: Score increases by 1.
            - Incorrect guess: Score decreases by 1 (if the score is greater than 0).
        - After each guess, the user is asked if they want to continue playing.

    Input:
        - Integer input (0â€“5) for guessing.
        - String input ('yes' or 'no') to continue or end the game.

    Error Handling:
        - Handles non-integer inputs for guessing.
        - Prompts again for invalid inputs when deciding whether to play again.

    Note:
        - The game continues until the user chooses not to play anymore.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If non-integer input is entered when guessing.
